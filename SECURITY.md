3. **Enable rate limiting** — Protect against brute force attacks
4. **Keep dependencies updated** — Regularly run `pip audit` and `npm audit`
5. **Use environment variables** — Never hardcode credentials
6. **Enable audit logging** — Monitor for suspicious activity
7. **Restrict CORS** — Only allow trusted origins
8. **Regular backups** — Maintain automated backup schedule
